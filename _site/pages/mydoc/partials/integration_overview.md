The integration consists in the inclusion of a JavaScript tag that allows acquiring the intentions of users during their navigation on your website.
The snippet is made up of two parts:

- The [loader](snippet_loader.html): a JavaScript library that has to be loaded on every page. It is required for the other snippets to interact with the Transactionale servers and to enable the UI for end users.
- The tracker: allows tracking the navigation events for your visitors (products they display or buy) that we will use to make the best targeted recommendations.

Implementing the tracker is quick, simple and invisible for users. The quality of our recommendations depends directly on the quality of the tracker implementation, including installing the tag on all the pages, providing all the available parameters, etc.

The tag:

- does not alter in any way the look of the website and is completely invidible to users
- it's asynchronous and does not slow down loading of the site
- must be integrated in the correct parts of the required pages of the website
